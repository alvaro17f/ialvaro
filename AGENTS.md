## Package manager

Always use **bun**. Never npm, yarn, or pnpm.

```sh
bun install
bun add <package>
bun remove <package>
```

## MANDATORY skills

Every task — no exceptions — must use these skills:

| Skill | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `tdd` | `/home/alvaro17f/.pi/agent/skills/tdd/SKILL.md` | Red-green-refactor loop. Write failing test first, then implement. |
| `gpt-taste` | `/home/alvaro17f/.pi/agent/skills/gpt-taste/SKILL.md` | Award-winning design engineering. AIDA structure, hero rules, bento grids, GSAP motion. |
| `conventional-commit` | `/home/alvaro17f/.pi/agent/skills/conventional-commit/SKILL.md` | Structured commit messages (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `BREAKING:`). |

**Before any implementation**, read the relevant skill files and follow their directives.

## TDD — NEGOTIABLE

1. **Write failing test first.**
2. **Run test — confirm it fails.**
3. **Write minimal code to pass.**
4. **Run test — confirm it passes.**
5. **Refactor — keep tests green.**

No code without a test. No exceptions.

## Banned practices

- Hardcoded values in components (use constants, props, or config)
- Inline styles mixing with Tailwind classes (pick one system)
- `any` types — use proper TypeScript typing
- Direct DOM manipulation outside React hooks/refs
- Unused imports — Biome linter runs on commit, keep it clean
- `console.log` in production code (use proper logging or remove)
- Skipping tests — if a test is hard to write, fix the design, don't skip the test
- Committing without conventional commit format

---

## Design rules (gpt-taste)

- Follow AIDA structure: Attention → Interest → Desire → Action
- Hero: 2-3 lines max, ultra-wide container, no centered text at high variance
- No "SECTION 01" or similar meta-labels
- No emojis in code, markup, or content
- No Inter font — use Outfit, Geist, Satoshi, or Cabinet Grotesk
- No purple/blue "AI gradient" aesthetic — single accent color, saturation < 80%
- Massive vertical spacing between sections (`py-32 md:py-48`)
- Gapless bento grids with `grid-flow-dense`

---

## Commit format

```
type(scope?): description

body?
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `build`, `ci`

Breaking changes: `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer.
