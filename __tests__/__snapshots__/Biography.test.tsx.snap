              </span>
               and I am a Full Stack Developer.
              <br />
              I feel very fortunate to have found what I am passionate about and to make it my job.
              <br />
              I have also worked managing, training and leading marketing teams at a national level.
              <br />
              If there is one thing that characterises me, it is that I am 100% involved in everything I do.
              <br />
              I am hard-working, perfectionist and non-conformist.
              <br />
              I have a direct and creative working style. And I put all the energy I get from working in what I am so enthusiastic about.
